## 🧠 What Is This Project About?

**Dig Deeper, Think Greener** is a personal and academic initiative that aims to spark thoughtful conversations about how mining and oil extraction impact the environment and the communities that live near these sites. While these industries are essential to our modern world, the processes used often leave lasting damage—polluted water, degraded land, and social disruption.

This project was created to encourage students, especially those studying **Petroleum and Mining Engineering**, to take a deeper look at the consequences of extraction and consider more sustainable and responsible practices.

## 🎯 Goals of the Project

* **Raise awareness** about the long-term environmental and social costs of resource extraction.
* **Start conversations** among students and future engineers through informal talks, group discussions, and workshops.
* **Highlight real stories** from people and communities affected by extraction industries.
* **Promote ethical thinking** in engineering—balancing efficiency with environmental responsibility.

## 🛠 How We’ll Do It

This project is not about blaming anyone—it's about **learning and reflecting**. Some of the ways we’ll engage people include:

* Hosting small group talks and open discussions
* Inviting guest speakers with field experience
* Exploring real-life case studies of extraction gone wrong (and right)
* Sharing insights online through this platform

---

## 🌿 Why It Matters

Most discussions in our field focus on technology, efficiency, and output. But what about the **human and environmental cost**?

* In many regions, extraction has left rivers polluted, forests destroyed, and communities displaced.
* These issues often go unspoken in academic and professional spaces.
* Future engineers have a **responsibility to understand the bigger picture**—because the decisions we make will shape the future of both people and the planet.

## 🙌 Join the Movement

**Dig Deeper, Think Greener** is just getting started. If you’re a student, educator, or professional who believes that engineering should also mean caring—this is your space.

Let’s talk. Let’s learn. Let’s think greener.
